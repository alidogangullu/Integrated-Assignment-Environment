# CE316 Programming Paradigms Course Project - The Integrated Assignment Environment

The Integrated Assignment Environment (IAE) is a lightweight application designed to facilitate the management of programming assignments. It provides an interface for creating, managing, and evaluating programming tasks. The key features of the IAE include:

1. Project Management: Users can create, edit, and remove projects, which serve as containers for assignments. Projects store configurations, results, and submitted student files.

2. Configuration Setup: Users can define configurations for different programming languages. These configurations specify the necessary steps to compile and run the student code. Configurations can be easily shared and reused.

3. ZIP File Processing: The IAE supports processing ZIP files containing student submissions. It automatically extracts the files and organizes them in project directories based on student IDs.

4. Compilation and Execution: The IAE utilizes the selected configuration to compile or interpret the student code. It handles command-line execution and reports any errors encountered during compilation or execution.

5. Output Comparison: The IAE compares the output of the student program with the expected output provided by the user. It determines the success or failure of the program based on the comparison result.

6. Results and Reporting: The IAE displays the results of each student file. Users can view the overall status of the assignments and access detailed reports.

The IAE is designed to be robust and standalone, with no dependencies on external servers or libraries for Windows computers and includes a help manual for guidance.
